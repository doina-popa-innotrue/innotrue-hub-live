## Key Source Files
- Supabase client: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Auth: `src/pages/Auth.tsx`, `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Routes: `src/App.tsx` | Sentry: `src/main.tsx` | Error boundary: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Edge functions: `supabase/functions/` (71 functions) | Shared: `_shared/cors.ts`, `ai-config.ts`, `email-utils.ts`, `error-response.ts`, `ai-input-limits.ts`, `calcom-utils.ts`, `content-access.ts`
- xAPI: `supabase/functions/xapi-launch/` (session create/resume), `supabase/functions/xapi-statements/` (LRS endpoint + state persistence)
- Assessment scoring: `src/lib/assessmentScoring.ts` (weighted question type scoring for capability assessments)
- Guided path instantiation: `src/lib/guidedPathInstantiation.ts` (shared template→goals service with pace/date logic)
- Tests: `src/lib/__tests__/` (18 files, 303 tests) | CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Seed: `supabase/seed.sql` | Cursor rules: `.cursorrules`

## Database Schema
- 380+ tables, 25 enums, 425+ migrations
- Key tables (CT3): `content_packages` (shared content library), `content_completions` (cross-program completion tracking), `program_modules.content_package_id` FK
- Key tables (waitlist): `cohort_waitlist` (user_id, cohort_id, position, notified), `programs.capacity`, `client_enrollments.enrollment_source/referred_by/referral_note`
- Key enums: `app_role` (admin, client, coach, instructor), `module_type`, `enrollment_status`
- **Two plan systems (independent, additive):**
  - **Subscription plans** (`plans` table, tier 0-4) — one per user (`profiles.plan_id`), Stripe-integrated, platform-wide features
  - **Program plans** (`program_plans`, per-enrollment features) — auto-resolved from enrollment tier, never set manually
  - `enroll_with_credits` RPC auto-resolves both: Step 0c defaults tier from `programs.tiers[0]`, Step 0d resolves `program_plan_id` from `program_tier_plans` → `programs.default_program_plan_id`
- `useEntitlements` merges 5 sources: subscription, program plan, add-ons, tracks, org-sponsored (highest wins)
- Credits additive: `plans.credit_allowance` (monthly, no rollover) + `program_plans.credit_allowance` + top-ups (10-year expiry, effectively permanent). FIFO consumes plan credits first.

## Three Assessment Systems (share `assessment_categories`)
| System | Table | Scoring | Visualization |
|--------|-------|---------|---------------|
| Capability | `capability_assessments` | Client-side domain averages — simple or weighted by question types (slider 1-N) | Radar (by domains or types) + evolution charts |
| Definitions (Public) | `assessment_definitions` | Server-side via `compute-assessment-scores` (confidential matrix) | Dimension bars + interpretation text |
| Psychometric | `psychometric_assessments` | None (document catalog/PDF upload) | None |

## Cohort & Session Infrastructure (already built)
- **Cohorts:** `program_cohorts` (status, capacity, dates) + `cohort_sessions` (date, time, meeting link, module link)
- **Waitlist:** `cohort_waitlist` (position-based queue, UNIQUE per user+cohort) + `check_cohort_capacity` RPC + `join_cohort_waitlist` RPC + `notify-cohort-waitlist` edge function
- **Program capacity:** `programs.capacity` column + `check_program_capacity` RPC — enforced in `enroll_with_credits` and `useProgramEnrollment`
- **Capacity enforcement:** `enroll_with_credits` RPC checks both program + cohort capacity (skippable with `p_force=true` for admin override)
- **Tier + plan auto-resolution:** `enroll_with_credits` Step 0c defaults `tier` from `programs.tiers[0]`, Step 0d resolves `program_plan_id` from `program_tier_plans` → `programs.default_program_plan_id`. All enrollment paths (self, codes, partner, admin) get correct tier + program plan automatically.
- **Enrollment attribution:** `client_enrollments.enrollment_source` (self/admin/enrollment_code/waitlist_promotion/partner_referral) + `referred_by` (UUID) + `referral_note` (text)
- **Unified sessions:** `sessions` + `session_types` (8 types: coaching, group_coaching, workshop, mastermind, review_board, peer_coaching, office_hours, webinar) + `session_type_roles` (10 roles)
- **Session participants:** `session_participants` with attendance workflow (invited → registered → confirmed → attended/no_show)
- **Groups:** `groups` + `group_memberships` + tasks, check-ins, notes, peer assessments, member links
- **Scheduling:** Cal.com (SSO, booking, webhook), Google Calendar (sync, iCal feeds), Calendly support
- **Staff assignment (3 tiers):** Program-level (`program_instructors`, `program_coaches`), Module-level (`module_instructors`, `module_coaches`), Enrollment-level (`enrollment_module_staff` — per-client per-module, many-to-many via `staff_user_id` + `role`, overrides above)
- **Direct client assignment:** `client_instructors`, `client_coaches`
- **Notifications:** 25+ types, 8 categories, email queue with retry, in-app notifications, announcements

## Content Delivery (current state + strategy)
- **Current flow (TalentLMS):** Rise → SCORM → TalentLMS → linked from Hub (5-7 clicks, 2 context switches — poor UX)
- **Existing integration:** `talentlms-sso` (SSO), `talentlms-webhook` (xAPI parsing), `sync-talentlms-progress` (manual sync)
- **Existing framework:** `external_sources` + `module_external_mappings` + `external_progress` (generic, any LMS)
- **Strategy (decided):** Skip SCORM entirely. Go: ~~Tier 1 (Rise Web embed via iframe)~~ ✅ → ~~Tier 2 (Rise xAPI direct to Hub)~~ ✅. TalentLMS kept for active programs only, no new programs added to it.
- **Why skip SCORM:** Rise exports xAPI natively; `talentlms-webhook` already parses xAPI; SCORM only tracks completion/score while xAPI tracks everything; xAPI data feeds AI coaching features

### Content Delivery Tier 2 — Rise xAPI Integration (✅ DONE 2026-02-22)
- **Architecture:** Rise xAPI ZIP → Supabase Storage → `serve-content-package` edge function (auth-gated proxy) → rendered in blob URL iframe on parent window → parent installs SCORM/LMS mock API → Rise calls parent window's mock → mock forwards xAPI statements to `xapi-statements` edge function
- **Session management:** `xapi-launch` edge function creates/resumes xAPI sessions with auth tokens. Resumes existing active sessions automatically (returns saved bookmark + suspend_data).
- **Statement processing:** `xapi-statements` edge function stores xAPI statements, auto-completes `module_progress` on completion/passed/mastered verbs, manages session lifecycle (initialized → completed → terminated)
- **Resume support:** Rise bookmark (scroll position) and suspend_data (full course state) saved via `PUT ?stateId=bookmark|suspend_data` on `xapi-statements`. On resume, saved state returned to frontend, LMS mock restores position.
- **Content rendering:** `ContentPackageViewer.tsx` — blob URL iframe approach. Fetches HTML from `serve-content-package`, rewrites relative URLs to absolute, renders in blob iframe. Installs LMS mock on parent window with `installLmsApiOnWindow()`. Supports both `web` (manual completion) and `xapi` (auto-tracking) content types.
- **Key stability fixes:** JWT token refresh no longer destroys iframe (accessToken stored in ref), xAPI completion no longer reloads page (React state update instead of `window.location.reload()`)
- **Database tables:** `xapi_sessions` (auth_token, status, bookmark, suspend_data), `xapi_statements` (verb_id, object_id, result fields, raw_statement JSONB)
- **Edge functions (3):** `xapi-launch` (session create/resume), `xapi-statements` (statement storage + state persistence), `serve-content-package` (content proxy — shared with Tier 1)
- **Module type:** `program_modules.content_package_type` enum: `web` (Tier 1 manual) or `xapi` (Tier 2 auto-tracking)

~~**Priority 0 — Content Delivery Tier 3: Shared Content Packages & Cross-Program Completion (CT3)**~~ ✅
Implemented: 1 migration (`20260224100000_ct3_shared_content_packages.sql`), 4 edge functions modified, new Content Library admin page, ModuleForm library picker, cross-program completion hook + auto-accept, CanonicalCodes extended with content packages tab. Deployed to all 3 environments.

- ~~**CT3a: Shared Content Library**~~ ✅ — `content_packages` table + `program_modules.content_package_id` FK. 3-mode upload (shared/replace/legacy). Admin Content Library page at `/admin/content-library`. ModuleForm two-tab picker (From Library / Upload New) with migrate-to-library button.
- ~~**CT3b: Cross-Program Completion**~~ ✅ — `content_completions` table. `xapi-statements` writes completion on xAPI verb. `useCrossProgramCompletion` extended with 3rd data source. Client `ModuleDetail` auto-accepts completion from shared content. `CanonicalCodesManagement` now shows content packages tab.
- **`canonical_code` override** — kept as manual override for different content that should count as equivalent.

**Phases:** ~~P0 cohort scheduling gaps (G1-G7)~~ ✅ → ~~Development Profile (DP1-DP4)~~ ✅ → ~~Content Tier 2 xAPI~~ ✅ → ~~Cohort quality (G9-G10, GT1)~~ ✅ → ~~DP5~~ ✅ → ~~CT3 Shared Content~~ ✅ → ~~DP6-DP7~~ ✅ → ~~G8 Enrollment Codes~~ ✅ → ~~5-Self-Registration core (Batches 1-3)~~ ✅ → ~~2B.7 Module Prerequisite UI + Time-Gating~~ ✅ → ~~2B.6 Waitlist/Cohort Management~~ ✅ → ~~2B.2 Partner Codes~~ ✅ → ~~2B.1 Alumni Lifecycle~~ ✅ → ~~2B.3 Pricing Update~~ ✅ → ~~Credit Economy Redesign (Phases 1-4)~~ ✅ → 2B.5 Certification → 2B.10 Enrollment Duration → 2B.13 Credit Expiry Policy → 2B.11 Feature Loss Communication → 2B.12 Feature Gain Visibility → Phase 5 remaining → 3-AI/Engagement

## Coach/Instructor Readiness
- **Teaching workflows:** ✅ All production-ready (assignments, scenarios, badges, assessments, groups, cohorts, client progress, notes)
- **Cohort teaching workflow (GT1) ✅ DONE:** Instructors AND coaches can browse cohorts (`/teaching/cohorts`), view cohort detail with sessions, mark attendance (reuses `CohortSessionAttendance`), edit recap + recording URL, notify clients via RPC, see homework assignments per session, view enrolled clients with attendance summary. Dashboard widget shows upcoming cohort sessions merged with group sessions. StudentDetail shows cohort assignment card. Symmetric RLS for both roles.
- **Onboarding:** ✅ DONE — Staff Welcome Card with 4-step checklist, Staff Profile setup (bio, specializations, company), enhanced empty states on teaching pages, role-specific welcome emails
- **Coach/instructor registration:** Self-registration with admin approval (Phase 5). Users apply at `/complete-registration`, get client role immediately, admin approves/declines via `/admin/coach-requests` "Role Applications" tab. Admin can also directly create via `/admin/users`.
- **Key pages:** `/teaching` (dashboard), `/teaching/students` (clients), `/teaching/readiness` (DP7 readiness dashboard), `/teaching/assignments`, `/teaching/scenarios`, `/teaching/badges`, `/teaching/assessments`, `/teaching/groups`, `/teaching/cohorts`
- **Remaining:** Teaching FAQ/quick guide page (nice to have)

## Instructor/Coach Assignment & Grading
- **3-tier staff assignment:** program → module → enrollment (personal per client). All have admin UI.
- **Assignment grading:** Full rubric support, scored_by tracking, email notifications, PendingAssignments page scoped by module/program
- **What works:** Assign instructor to module (everyone sees same), personal instructor per client (ALL modules — individualized filter removed 2026-02-18), grading with rubric + development items, **"My Queue" filtering** on PendingAssignments, **assignment transfer dialog** between staff members
- **Session scheduling:** Already enrollment-aware via `useModuleSchedulingUrl` hook — resolves Cal.com booking URL using 3-tier hierarchy (enrollment_module_staff → module_instructors → program_instructors). No changes needed.
- **Notification behavior:** `notify-assignment-submitted` now uses smart routing — personal instructor (`enrollment_module_staff`) gets priority; falls back to broadcast to ALL instructors/coaches at module + program level. `notify-assignment-graded` notifies client.
- **Client sees personal instructor:** ✅ `ModuleTeamContact` checks `enrollment_module_staff` and highlights personal instructor with distinct styling
- **Remaining gaps:** `assessor_id` field is working correctly (tracks who created assessment, `scored_by` tracks grader)
- **Key components:** `InstructorCoachAssignment` (module/program), `EnrollmentModuleStaffManager` (per-client per-module), `InstructorAssignmentScoring` (grading), `PendingAssignments` (queue), `TransferAssignmentDialog` (transfer)
- **Key hooks:** `useModuleSchedulingUrl` (3-tier Cal.com URL resolution, enrollment-aware)
- **Key edge functions:** `notify-assignment-submitted` (async, broadcasts), `notify-assignment-graded` (async, notifies client)
- **Note:** `client_instructors`/`client_coaches` are separate from `enrollment_module_staff` — used for general coaching relationships (decisions, tasks), not synced by design

## Known Issues
- (none currently — all critical/high items documented in roadmap above)

## Resolved Issues
- **C1 — Credits FeatureGate (2026-02-15):** Removed FeatureGate wrapper from Credits.tsx — credits is universal across all plans.
- **C2 — AuthContext role fallback (2026-02-15):** Removed silent `roles = ["client"]` fallback from 4 locations. Added `authError` state + error/no-roles UI in ProtectedRoute. Unblocks safe Google OAuth re-enable.
- **C3 — Credit loss on failed enrollment (2026-02-15):** Created `enroll_with_credits` atomic RPC. Credits + enrollment in single transaction with auto-rollback. Also fixed M6 (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` on `consume_credits_fifo`).
- **H1 — Empty client dashboard (2026-02-16):** Added OnboardingWelcomeCard with 4-step getting-started checklist. Auto-hides on completion or dismiss (localStorage).
- **C4 — Cal.com orphaned bookings (2026-02-16):** Auto-cancel Cal.com booking on DB failure in both calcom-create-booking and calcom-webhook. Added BOOKING_CANCELLED handler for two-way sync. Created `_shared/calcom-utils.ts` helper.
- **H2 — File upload validation (2026-02-16):** Created `src/lib/fileValidation.ts` with bucket-specific MIME/size presets. Applied to all 13 upload interfaces across admin, client, coach, instructor areas.
- **H3 — AI input limits (2026-02-16):** Created `_shared/ai-input-limits.ts` with truncation helpers. Applied to 3 AI edge functions (generate-reflection-prompt, course-recommendations, decision-insights).
- **H5 — Express interest status (2026-02-16):** Added "My Interest Registrations" section to ClientDashboard with color-coded status badges (pending/contacted/enrolled/declined).
- **H4 — Welcome email (2026-02-15):** verify-signup now triggers send-welcome-email after successful verification (non-blocking, service role auth).
- **H7 — N+1 query (2026-02-15):** Replaced per-module progress queries with single batched `.in()` query in ClientDetail.
- **H8 — Assignment grading guard (2026-02-15):** Added status check — grading only allowed when assignment is "submitted".
- **Preprod Auth Email Hook (2026-02-14):** Incorrect Authorization header. Fixed with correct service role key.
- **Profiles RLS recursion (2026-02-14):** Circular RLS on profiles. Fixed via `client_can_view_staff_profile()` SECURITY DEFINER function.

Remaining: Wheel of Life pipeline (Step 7), bulk import (Step 9), public assessment funnels (Step 12), org self-service (Step 13).
- **AI infrastructure:** 4 edge functions (decision-insights, course-recommendations, generate-reflection-prompt, analytics-ai-insights), Vertex AI Gemini 3 Flash (EU/Frankfurt), input truncation, credit-based consumption (`useConsumableFeature("ai_insights")` pattern), explicit consent gating, provider-agnostic architecture. All AI features gated behind `ai_insights` feature key with plan-based credit limits (free=5, base=50, pro=100, advanced=200, elite=300).
- **Product strategy documented** (`docs/PRODUCT_STRATEGY_YOUNG_PROFESSIONALS_AND_AI_LEARNING.md`): 6 parts — young professionals (12 ideas), AI learning (5 features), content delivery (skip SCORM → xAPI), cohort readiness (6 gaps), coach/instructor onboarding (6 gaps), instructor/coach assignment & grading routing (6 gaps)
- **Content delivery Tier 1 + Tier 2 DONE:** Tier 1: Rise ZIP upload + auth-gated edge function proxy + iframe embed in ModuleDetail. Private storage bucket, JWT + enrollment check on every request. Tier 2: Rise xAPI integration with session management (`xapi-launch`), statement storage (`xapi-statements`), auto-completion on xAPI verbs, resume support (bookmark + suspend_data persistence). TalentLMS kept for active programs only.
- **Cohort core experience + G1-G7 DONE:** CohortDashboard (schedule timeline, next session, ICS, progress), CohortSessionCard (time-aware status, pulsing join, ICS), Calendar integration, ClientDashboard widget. G1-G7 gaps resolved: cohort assignment on enrollment (`enroll_with_credits` RPC with `p_cohort_id`), Google Meet automation, instructor assignment on cohorts (`lead_instructor_id`) and sessions (`instructor_id`), attendance tracking (`cohort_session_attendance` — instructors/coaches mark, clients read own), bulk session generation, session reminders (`send-schedule-reminders` edge function), session notes/recap (instructors edit, participants view). **Remaining:** G8 (session quality/feedback), G9 (cohort analytics), G10 (multi-cohort management). See `docs/COHORT_SCHEDULING_ANALYSIS.md`.
- **Coach/instructor onboarding DONE:** Staff Welcome Card, profile setup (bio, specializations, company), enhanced empty states, role-specific welcome emails.
- **Assignment routing DONE:** My Queue filtering, assignment transfer dialog, async notifications via create_notification RPC. Remaining: configurable notification routing (nice to have), assessor_id cleanup.
- **Development Profile DP1-DP7 DONE** (`docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROFILE_ANALYSIS.md`): Assessment↔goal linking (`goal_assessment_links`), unified Development Profile page (7 sections), assessment-gated milestones (`guided_path_milestone_gates` + `milestone_gate_overrides`), path instantiation service (`guided_path_instantiations`), module↔domain mapping (`module_domain_mappings`), psychometric structured results (`psychometric_result_schemas` + `psychometric_results`), readiness dashboard (coach + client).
- **Key new components (DP1-DP4):**
  - `src/pages/client/DevelopmentProfile.tsx` — unified 5-section development profile (StrengthsGapsMatrix, ActiveDevelopmentItems, AssessmentGoalProgress, SkillsEarned, GuidedPathProgress)
  - `src/pages/instructor/StudentDevelopmentProfile.tsx` — coach/instructor view of client's development profile
  - `src/lib/guidedPathInstantiation.ts` — shared `instantiateTemplate()` + `estimateCompletionDate()` service
  - `src/components/guided-paths/PathConfirmation.tsx` — pace selector + instantiation confirmation
  - `src/components/guided-paths/MilestoneGateStatus.tsx` — traffic-light gate indicators (🟢🟡🔴⚪)
  - `src/components/guided-paths/MilestoneGateDialog.tsx` — admin gate config dialog
  - `src/components/guided-paths/WaiveGateDialog.tsx` — coach/instructor gate waiver
  - `src/hooks/useGoalAssessmentLinks.ts` — goal↔assessment CRUD
  - `src/hooks/useMilestoneGates.ts` — gates CRUD, batch fetch, status computation, overrides
- **Content delivery Tier 2 xAPI DONE** (2026-02-22): 3 new edge functions (`xapi-launch`, `xapi-statements`, plus modified `serve-content-package`), 2 new DB tables (`xapi_sessions`, `xapi_statements`), `ContentPackageViewer.tsx` rewritten with LMS mock + resume support. Deployed to prod + preprod.
- **Key xAPI components:**
  - `src/components/modules/ContentPackageViewer.tsx` — blob URL iframe rendering, LMS mock installation, xAPI launch/resume, bookmark/suspend_data persistence
  - `supabase/functions/xapi-launch/index.ts` — session create/resume, auth token generation, enrollment/staff access checks
  - `supabase/functions/xapi-statements/index.ts` — statement storage, session lifecycle, auto-completion, state persistence
- **AI reflection prompt fix (2026-02-19):** `WeeklyReflectionCard` now gated behind `hasFeature("ai_insights")`, consumes credits via `useConsumableFeature("ai_insights")` before generating, shows remaining credits + specific error messages (rate limit vs credit exhaustion vs generic). Edge function returns specific 429/402 responses. Hook parses error body for user-friendly messages.
- **G8 Self-Enrollment Codes (2026-02-25):** `enrollment_codes` table with RLS, `validate_enrollment_code` SECURITY DEFINER RPC, `redeem-enrollment-code` edge function (free enrollments only for G8 scope), admin EnrollmentCodesManagement page with quick code generator + full CRUD dialog, public `/enroll` page with code validation → program info → auth redirect → enrollment flow. Notification type `enrollment_code_redeemed` notifies code creator. Shareable links: `{origin}/enroll?code={CODE}`.
- **Phase 5 Self-Registration Core (2026-02-26):** Migration (`20260226100000_phase5_self_registration.sql`) adds `profiles.registration_status/verification_status/verified_at`, `signup_verification_requests.plan_interest/context_data`, `coach_instructor_requests.source_type/specialties/certifications/bio/scheduling_url`. `complete-registration` edge function handles role selection (client → immediate, coach/instructor → pending_approval + client role), free plan assignment, Google OAuth placeholder transfer (7 tables). `CompleteRegistration.tsx` three-card role selection page. `verify-signup` modified: sets `registration_status: 'pending_role_selection'`, no longer auto-assigns client role, enhanced 7-table placeholder transfer. Auth.tsx re-enabled: signup form + Google OAuth + tab switching. AuthContext tracks `registrationStatus`. ProtectedRoute redirects `pending_role_selection` to `/complete-registration`. `CoachInstructorRequests.tsx` rewritten with "Role Applications" tab (approve adds role on top of client, decline keeps client) and "Coach Assignments" tab (existing flow).
- **Key Phase 5 components:**
  - `src/pages/CompleteRegistration.tsx` — role selection after signup verification (client/coach/instructor/organization)
  - `supabase/functions/complete-registration/index.ts` — role assignment, free plan, placeholder transfer for Google OAuth
  - `src/pages/admin/CoachInstructorRequests.tsx` — dual-tab: Role Applications (approve/decline) + Coach Assignments (existing)
- **Phase 5 deployment fixes (2026-02-26):**
  - CORS: added `*.innotrue-hub-live.pages.dev` wildcard to `_shared/cors.ts` for Cloudflare Pages preview URLs
  - `config.toml`: added `complete-registration` and `redeem-enrollment-code` with `verify_jwt = false` (were missing, causing relay rejection)
  - `signup-user`: changed `email_confirm: true` in `createUser()` to suppress duplicate auth hook email ("Set Up Your Account")
  - Auth.tsx: check `data.error` before `error` in signup handler (show specific messages not generic "Edge Function returned a non-2xx"), switch to login tab after successful signup
  - ProtectedRoute: detect Google OAuth new users (`app_metadata.provider === "google"` + zero roles) and redirect to `/complete-registration` instead of "Account Not Configured"
  - **Google OAuth root cause:** `handle_new_user` trigger sets `registration_status='complete'` (column default) for ALL new users. Required 3 fixes: (1) detect OAuth new users by `zero roles + provider === "google"` only (not `!registrationStatus`), (2) `complete-registration` idempotency guard must also check `user_roles` count (was short-circuiting with `already_complete` before creating any roles), (3) `CompleteRegistration.tsx` redirect guard must check `userRoles.length > 0` before redirecting to `/dashboard`
  - Added sign out button to `/complete-registration` page
  - Index.tsx: 500ms fast fallback to `/dashboard` for Google OAuth users (vs 6s for others), ProtectedRoute then catches and redirects to `/complete-registration`
- **2B.7 Module Prerequisite UI + Time-Gating (2026-02-22):** Lock icons + "Complete X first" messages + disabled states on client module lists. Time-gating via `available_from_date` column on `program_modules` — modules hidden before date. Admin toggle in module editor. Commit `783f06d`.
- **2B.6 Cohort Waitlist Management (2026-03-01):** Full waitlist system with capacity enforcement, enrollment attribution, admin management, and notifications. 3 migrations, 2 new components, 1 new edge function, 6 modified files.
  - **Enrollment source tracking:** 3 columns on `client_enrollments` (`enrollment_source`, `referred_by`, `referral_note`) — tracks self/admin/enrollment_code/waitlist_promotion/partner_referral attribution
  - **Program-level capacity:** `programs.capacity` column + `check_program_capacity` RPC — enforced in `enroll_with_credits` and `useProgramEnrollment`
  - **Cohort waitlist:** `cohort_waitlist` table (position-based queue) + `check_cohort_capacity` RPC + `join_cohort_waitlist` RPC + RLS policies (users manage own, admins manage all)
  - **Capacity enforcement in `enroll_with_credits`:** New params `p_force` (admin override), `p_enrollment_source`, `p_referred_by`, `p_referral_note`. 13 params total (was 9, backward compatible). Program + cohort capacity checked unless `p_force=true`.
  - **Client UI:** `CohortWaitlistButton.tsx` — join/leave waitlist, position badge, capacity-aware visibility
  - **Admin UI:** `CohortWaitlistManager.tsx` — table with promote/remove actions, waitlist count badges in ProgramCohortsManager
  - **Notification:** `notify-cohort-waitlist` edge function — notifies next N users when spots open, reuses `waitlist_spot_available` email template
  - **Capacity check in `redeem-enrollment-code`:** Program + cohort capacity checked before enrollment
  - **Admin override:** `p_force=true` in ClientDetail.tsx admin enrollment and waitlist promotion — skips all capacity checks
- **Key waitlist components:**
  - `src/components/cohort/CohortWaitlistButton.tsx` — client-facing join/leave waitlist
  - `src/components/admin/CohortWaitlistManager.tsx` — admin promote/remove waitlist entries
  - `supabase/functions/notify-cohort-waitlist/index.ts` — spot availability notification
- **2B.2 Partner Codes MVP (2026-03-01):** Partner referral attribution system. `partner_codes` + `partner_referrals` tables with RLS. `validate_partner_code` RPC. `redeem-partner-code` edge function (validates → capacity check → enroll_with_credits with `enrollment_source='partner_referral'`). Admin `PartnerCodesManagement.tsx` (PRT prefix generator, CRUD, partner filter, copy code/link, **tier selector**). Public `/partner?code=X` redemption page (**shows tier badge**). Teaching dashboard referral stats card. Sidebar nav link. `partner_codes.grants_tier` column for tier override.
- **2B.1 Alumni Lifecycle (2026-03-01):** Read-only content access for completed enrollments with configurable grace period. `completed_at` column + trigger on `client_enrollments`. `check_alumni_access` RPC. Shared `_shared/content-access.ts` modifies `serve-content-package` + `xapi-launch` with staff→active→alumni→denied access chain. `alumni-lifecycle` cron function sends nurture emails at 0/30/60/90d + grace expiry. `alumni_touchpoints` table prevents duplicates. `useAlumniAccess` hook + read-only banner in ContentPackageViewer. xAPI suppressed in read-only mode. Admin alumni info in ClientDetail.
- **2B.3 Pricing Update (2026-03-01):** Migration updates plan_prices to €49/99/179/249 monthly + annual at 20% discount. Credits scaled ~2x (300/500/1000/1500). `stripe_price_id` nulled for Stripe auto-create. Continuation plan deactivated. Subscription page already had toggle — no frontend changes needed.
- **Key new files (2B.2 + 2B.1 + 2B.3):**
  - `supabase/migrations/20260301110000_partner_codes.sql` — partner codes + referrals tables
  - `supabase/migrations/20260301120000_alumni_lifecycle.sql` — alumni grace period system
  - `supabase/migrations/20260301130000_pricing_update.sql` — pricing + credits + continuation deprecation
  - `supabase/functions/redeem-partner-code/index.ts` — partner code redemption
  - `supabase/functions/_shared/content-access.ts` — shared content access helper (staff/active/alumni/denied)
  - `supabase/functions/alumni-lifecycle/index.ts` — alumni nurture cron
  - `src/pages/admin/PartnerCodesManagement.tsx` — admin partner codes CRUD
  - `src/pages/public/RedeemPartnerCode.tsx` — public partner code redemption
  - `src/hooks/useAlumniAccess.ts` — alumni status hook
- **Tier & Program Plan Defaulting (2026-03-01):** Ensures every enrollment has consistent tier + program_plan_id. Migration `20260301140000_tier_defaulting.sql` adds:
  - `partner_codes.grants_tier` column + updated `validate_partner_code` RPC
  - `enroll_with_credits` Step 0c: tier defaults to `programs.tiers[0]` when NULL
  - `enroll_with_credits` Step 0d: `program_plan_id` resolved from `program_tier_plans(program_id, tier_name)` → `programs.default_program_plan_id` fallback
  - Fixed `redeem-enrollment-code` bug: was passing `grants_plan_id` (subscription plan FK) as `p_program_plan_id` (program plan FK) — now passes NULL, lets RPC resolve correctly
  - Partner codes admin UI: tier selector, tier badge on redemption page
  - All enrollment paths (self, enrollment codes, partner codes, admin) now auto-resolve tier + program plan
- **Stripe Credit Bundles Sync (2026-03-02):** Synced 8 Stripe "Credit Bundle" products to `org_credit_packages` with `stripe_price_id` linking. Volume-based bonus credits: 5%→40%. Migration `20260302100000_sync_stripe_credit_bundles.sql`. No individual top-up products in Stripe yet (auto-created on first checkout).
- **Credit Economy Redesign (2026-03-02 – 2026-03-03):** Unified 2:1 credit-to-EUR ratio across all pricing. 4-phase implementation:
  - **Phase 1 (Credit Recalibration):** Migration `20260302120000_credit_recalibration_2to1.sql` recalibrates all plans, packages, services, and program costs to 2:1 ratio. Seed.sql updated for fresh environments.
  - **Phase 2 (Top Up & Enrol UX):** Smart package recommendation on Credits page (reads `pendingEnrollment` from sessionStorage, computes shortfall, finds smallest adequate package). Contextual large package display (≥€1,500 hidden unless needed). "Top Up & Enroll" one-click flow. Discount code input in enrollment dialog with per-tier credit cost display. Credit cost badges on program cards. `creditsToEur()` and `formatCreditsAsEur()` utility functions in `useUserCredits.ts`.
  - **Phase 3 (Installment Plans):** `payment_schedules` table (migration `20260303010000`). Per-program installment config (`installment_options` JSONB, `upfront_discount_percent` on programs). `create-installment-checkout` edge function (Stripe subscription with `cancel_at` for fixed-term). Webhook handlers for `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`, `subscription.deleted` with credit_installment metadata routing. Client UI payment plan selector (RadioGroup: pay in full / 3x / 6x / 12x). Enhanced `PlanLockOverlay` for payment_outstanding. Admin `PaymentSchedulesManagement` dashboard with stats, progress bars, status badges.
  - **Phase 4 (Documentation):** Updated MEMORY.md, completed-work.md, SUBSCRIPTIONS_AND_PLANS.md.
- **Key credit economy components:**
  - `src/pages/client/Credits.tsx` — complete rewrite: smart recommendation, contextual display, installment selector, "Top Up & Enroll" flow
  - `src/pages/client/ExplorePrograms.tsx` — credit cost badges on program cards, discount code wiring
  - `src/components/programs/ExpressInterestDialog.tsx` — `tierCreditCosts` map, per-tier cost display in RadioGroup
  - `src/components/admin/ProgramPlanConfig.tsx` — installment options checkboxes (3/6/12 months), upfront discount percent
  - `src/pages/admin/PaymentSchedulesManagement.tsx` — admin installment tracking dashboard
  - `supabase/functions/create-installment-checkout/index.ts` — Stripe subscription-as-instalment
  - Stripe webhook (`stripe-webhook/index.ts`) — installment lifecycle handlers (invoice.paid, payment_failed, subscription.deleted)
- **Remove Continuation Plan (2026-03-04):** Deleted ContinuationBanner component, removed continuation state from ClientDashboard, rewrote ProgramCompletions as read-only view (no "Move to Continuation"), updated AdminFAQ/PlansManagement/platformDocumentation/seed.sql. Safety-net migration `20260304100000_remove_continuation_plan.sql` moves any remaining Continuation users to Free. Alumni lifecycle (2B.1) handles completed programs — alumni is an enrollment-level state, not a plan change.
- **Stripe Webhook Config (2026-03-04):** Webhooks configured in both preprod (test mode) and production (live mode) with all 5 events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.paid`, `invoice.payment_failed`. `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` + `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` set in both environments. Stripe price IDs auto-created on first checkout per environment.
- **Enrollment Lifecycle Features (decided 2026-03-04):** Three new roadmap items:
  - **2B.10 Enrollment Duration & Deadline Enforcement** (🔴 High) — `programs.default_duration_days` → auto-calculate `end_date` → cron enforces expiry → alumni grace starts. Prevents indefinite feature freeloading. Foundation: `end_date` column exists but unenforced, `alumni-lifecycle` cron extensible.
  - **2B.11 Feature Loss Communication** (🟠 High) — pre-completion warning (features you'll lose), post-completion dashboard notice, alumni grace banner with days remaining, `useRecentlyLostFeatures()` hook. Foundation: `useEntitlements().getAccessSource()`, `useAlumniAccess().days_remaining`.
  - **2B.12 Feature Gain Visibility** (🟡 Medium) — "What's included" on program page, dashboard feature attribution badges ("Via [Program]"), subscription page context. Foundation: `getAccessSource()`, `program_plan_features` table.
- **Credit Expiry Policy (decided 2026-03-04):** Purchased credits (top-ups + org bundles) changed from 12-month to **10-year expiry** (effectively permanent). Plan credits continue monthly reset with no rollover. Rationale: users paid real money — expiring paid credits erodes trust; FIFO already consumes plan credits first so purchased are naturally protected; 10-year avoids permanent deferred revenue liability. Migration needed to update `grant_credit_batch`, edge functions, and existing batches. Full spec in `docs/CREDIT_ECONOMY_AND_PAYMENTS.md` Section 11.
  - **2B.13 Credit Expiry Awareness** (🟠 High) — dashboard expiry banner (data exists via `get_user_credit_summary_v2`), email notification cron (`credits_expiring` notification type exists but no cron sends it), AI spend suggestions (future, Phase 3).
- **Admin Features Management UX (noted 2026-03-04):** Deny checkbox (`plan_features.is_restrictive`) is fully implemented end-to-end but **only takes effect for org-sponsored plans** — `useEntitlements` checks `is_restrictive` only in `fetchOrgSponsoredFeatures`. UI needs clarification. Also: "Programs" plan column needs explanation (admin-only, features come from per-program config not this grid), non-purchasable plans should be moved to end of table with separator.
  - **2B.14 Admin Features UX** (🟡 Medium) — deny scope tooltip, Programs plan info banner, column reordering (purchasable first, special plans at end), Enterprise legacy note if present.
- **enrollment_module_staff Unified Schema (2026-03-23):** Restructured from `instructor_id`/`coach_id` columns (one row per enrollment+module) to `staff_user_id` + `role` pattern (many-to-many). Migration `20260323100000_enrollment_module_staff_unified.sql`. Updated: `EnrollmentModuleStaffManager.tsx` (admin), `useModuleSchedulingUrl.ts`, `types.ts` regenerated. RLS policies recreated with staff self-service (view/update/insert). `client_can_view_staff_profile` function and `instructor_calcom_event_types` policy updated. Code in `ModuleTeamContact.tsx`, `TransferAssignmentDialog.tsx`, `PendingAssignments.tsx`, `notify-assignment-submitted` already used `staff_user_id`/`role` — DB now matches.
- **Schema Change Prevention Protocol (2026-03-23):** Added to CLAUDE.md. All DB changes MUST go through migrations + type regeneration + verify. Never apply schema changes directly to Supabase dashboard without a migration file.
- **Schema Drift Audit (2026-03-23):** Comprehensive audit found widespread code-to-DB mismatches. Full report: `docs/SCHEMA_DRIFT_AUDIT.md`.
  - 🟡 **Lovable type mismatch** — 20+ files use `as string` casts for tables that DO exist in DB but weren't in Lovable's type snapshot. Resolves by pushing current `types.ts`. RPC return types (`enroll_with_credits`, `join_cohort_waitlist`) return `Json` — need type assertions.
  - 🔵 **`credit-maintenance` has no cron trigger** — function exists but nothing invokes it. Credits may not be expiring as intended.
- **Schema Drift Fixes (2026-03-24):** All 3 sprints completed (18 files, 3 migrations). Details in `completed-work.md`.
  - ✅ Sprint 1 (CRITICAL): `profiles.email` + `profiles.is_disabled` columns added via migration + sync trigger, `full_name` → `name` in 5 files + 2 DB functions, `notify_session_participant_added` + `staff_has_client_relationship` fixed, 3 edge functions belt-and-suspenders
  - ✅ Sprint 2 (HIGH): 7 files fixed — phantom tables (`client_sessions`, `user_subscriptions`, `organization_subscriptions`, `wheel_of_life_scores`, `user_organization_sharing_consent`, `instructor_assignments`) replaced with correct tables, `payment_schedules.enrollment_id` made nullable, `platform_tier_id` phantom column removed
  - ✅ Sprint 3 (MEDIUM): `calendar-feed` fully rewritten — uses `module_session_participants` → `module_sessions`, `group_memberships` → `group_sessions`, `client_enrollments` → `cohort_sessions` (new), batch instructor name lookup, removed broken assignment section
  - ⚠️ Remaining: Lovable type mismatch (resolves with `types.ts` push), `credit-maintenance` cron trigger (no scheduler configured)
- **Next steps:** 2B.5 Certification → 2B.10 Enrollment Duration → 2B.13 Credit Expiry Policy Migration → 2B.11 Feature Loss Communication → Phase 5 remaining (Wheel pipeline, bulk import) → Phase 3 AI

## Env Vars (41 total)
Full reference: `docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md`
- NEVER share: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, Cal.com/TalentLMS/Circle keys
- Safe to share: `RESEND_API_KEY` (with staging override), `GCP_*` (stateless)
- MUST set on all envs: `SITE_URL` (falls back to prod URL if unset)

## Notes
- `npm install` needs `--legacy-peer-deps` (react-day-picker conflict)
- Edge functions all have `verify_jwt = false` — custom auth checks inside
- `send-auth-email` uses Standard Webhooks HMAC (not Bearer token)
- Supabase RPC params must use `null` not `undefined` (undefined stripped from JSON)
- Demo credentials: all use `DemoPass123!` — see `supabase/seed.sql`
