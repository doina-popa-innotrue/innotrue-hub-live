## Key Source Files
- Supabase client: `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts`
- Auth: `src/pages/Auth.tsx`, `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Routes: `src/App.tsx` | Sentry: `src/main.tsx` | Error boundary: `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Edge functions: `supabase/functions/` (61 functions) | Shared: `_shared/cors.ts`, `ai-config.ts`, `email-utils.ts`
- Assessment scoring: `src/lib/assessmentScoring.ts` (weighted question type scoring for capability assessments)
- Tests: `src/lib/__tests__/` (18 files, 303 tests) | CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Seed: `supabase/seed.sql` | Cursor rules: `.cursorrules`

## Database Schema
- 369+ tables, 25 enums, 411 migrations
- Key enums: `app_role` (admin, client, coach, instructor), `module_type`, `enrollment_status`
- **Two plan systems:** Subscription plans (`plans` table, tier 0-4) + Program plans (`program_plans`, per-enrollment features)
- `useEntitlements` merges 5 sources: subscription, program plan, add-ons, tracks, org-sponsored (highest wins)
- Credits additive: `plans.credit_allowance` + `program_plans.credit_allowance` + top-ups

## Three Assessment Systems (share `assessment_categories`)
| System | Table | Scoring | Visualization |
|--------|-------|---------|---------------|
| Capability | `capability_assessments` | Client-side domain averages — simple or weighted by question types (slider 1-N) | Radar (by domains or types) + evolution charts |
| Definitions (Public) | `assessment_definitions` | Server-side via `compute-assessment-scores` (confidential matrix) | Dimension bars + interpretation text |
| Psychometric | `psychometric_assessments` | None (document catalog/PDF upload) | None |

## Cohort & Session Infrastructure (already built)
- **Cohorts:** `program_cohorts` (status, capacity, dates) + `cohort_sessions` (date, time, meeting link, module link)
- **Unified sessions:** `sessions` + `session_types` (8 types: coaching, group_coaching, workshop, mastermind, review_board, peer_coaching, office_hours, webinar) + `session_type_roles` (10 roles)
- **Session participants:** `session_participants` with attendance workflow (invited → registered → confirmed → attended/no_show)
- **Groups:** `groups` + `group_memberships` + tasks, check-ins, notes, peer assessments, member links
- **Scheduling:** Cal.com (SSO, booking, webhook), Google Calendar (sync, iCal feeds), Calendly support
- **Staff assignment (3 tiers):** Program-level (`program_instructors`, `program_coaches`), Module-level (`module_instructors`, `module_coaches`), Enrollment-level (`enrollment_module_staff` — per-client per-module, overrides above)
- **Direct client assignment:** `client_instructors`, `client_coaches`
- **Notifications:** 25+ types, 8 categories, email queue with retry, in-app notifications, announcements

## Content Delivery (current state + strategy)
- **Current flow (TalentLMS):** Rise → SCORM → TalentLMS → linked from Hub (5-7 clicks, 2 context switches — poor UX)
- **Existing integration:** `talentlms-sso` (SSO), `talentlms-webhook` (xAPI parsing), `sync-talentlms-progress` (manual sync)
- **Existing framework:** `external_sources` + `module_external_mappings` + `external_progress` (generic, any LMS)
- **Strategy (decided):** Skip SCORM entirely. Go: Tier 1 (Rise Web embed via iframe, 3-5 days) → Tier 2 (Rise xAPI direct to Hub, 1-2 weeks). TalentLMS kept for active programs only, no new programs added to it.
- **Why skip SCORM:** Rise exports xAPI natively; `talentlms-webhook` already parses xAPI; SCORM only tracks completion/score while xAPI tracks everything; xAPI data feeds AI coaching features

- Content Tier 2 xAPI direct — not started (1-2 weeks)
- Cohort scheduling gaps — see below

**Priority 0 — Cohort Scheduling Gaps (see `docs/COHORT_SCHEDULING_ANALYSIS.md` for full analysis):**
- G1: Cohort assignment UI on enrollment (1 day) — **blocker**
- G2: Google Meet link automation for sessions (2 days) — **blocker**
- G3: Instructor assignment on cohort/session (1-2 days) — high
- G4: Attendance tracking (2-3 days) — high
- G5: Recurring session generation (1-2 days) — high
- G6: Session notifications/reminders (2 days) — high
- G7: Session notes/recap (3 days) — medium
- G8: Enrollment codes (2-3 days) — Phase 5
- G9: Cohort analytics dashboard (1 week) — medium
- G10: Session-linked homework (3-5 days) — medium

**Priority 0 — Development Profile & Assessment-Driven Guided Paths (see `docs/DEVELOPMENT_PROFILE_ANALYSIS.md`):**
Approved for development 2026-02-18. Connects 3 assessment systems + development items + goals + guided paths into unified development journey.
- DP1: Assessment ↔ Goal traceability (1-2 days) — `goal_assessment_links` table
- DP2: Development Profile page (3-5 days) — unified strengths/gaps/progress view
- DP3: Assessment-gated milestones (3-5 days) — traffic-light readiness on guided path milestones, coach override
- DP4: Intake-driven path recommendation (3-5 days) — fix survey instantiation bug, conditional skip, pace multiplier, estimated duration
- DP5: Module ↔ domain mapping (2-3 days) — modules tagged to assessment domains
- DP6: Psychometric structured results (2-3 days) — manual score entry for DISC/VIA/etc.
- DP7: Readiness dashboard (3-5 days) — capstone coach + client view combining all data
- **Known bug:** `GuidedPathSurveyWizard` saves survey response but never instantiates template goals/milestones (fixed in DP4)

**Phases:** **P0 cohort scheduling gaps (G1-G6)** → **Development Profile (DP1-DP4)** → 5-Self-Registration → Development Profile (DP5-DP7) → Content Tier 2 xAPI → 3-AI/Engagement → 1-Onboarding → 2-Assessment → 4-Peer → 6-Enterprise → 7-Mobile → 8-Integrations → 9-Strategic

## Coach/Instructor Readiness
- **Teaching workflows:** ✅ All production-ready (assignments, scenarios, badges, assessments, groups, client progress, notes)
- **Onboarding:** ✅ DONE — Staff Welcome Card with 4-step checklist, Staff Profile setup (bio, specializations, company), enhanced empty states on teaching pages, role-specific welcome emails
- **Admin creates coaches** via `/admin/users` — no self-registration needed currently
- **Key pages:** `/teaching` (dashboard), `/teaching/students` (clients), `/teaching/assignments`, `/teaching/scenarios`, `/teaching/badges`, `/teaching/assessments`, `/teaching/groups`
- **Remaining:** Teaching FAQ/quick guide page (nice to have)

## Instructor/Coach Assignment & Grading
- **3-tier staff assignment:** program → module → enrollment (personal per client). All have admin UI.
- **Assignment grading:** Full rubric support, scored_by tracking, email notifications, PendingAssignments page scoped by module/program
- **What works:** Assign instructor to module (everyone sees same), personal instructor per client (ALL modules — individualized filter removed 2026-02-18), grading with rubric + development items, **"My Queue" filtering** on PendingAssignments, **assignment transfer dialog** between staff members
- **Session scheduling:** Already enrollment-aware via `useModuleSchedulingUrl` hook — resolves Cal.com booking URL using 3-tier hierarchy (enrollment_module_staff → module_instructors → program_instructors). No changes needed.
- **Notification behavior:** `notify-assignment-submitted` and `notify-assignment-graded` now use async `create_notification` RPC (non-blocking). Broadcasts to ALL instructors/coaches at module + program level — intentionally kept for partner instructors in small teams.
- **Remaining gaps:** Configurable notification routing (nice to have), `assessor_id` cleanup (nice to have), client doesn't see personal instructor (nice to have)
- **Key components:** `InstructorCoachAssignment` (module/program), `EnrollmentModuleStaffManager` (per-client per-module), `InstructorAssignmentScoring` (grading), `PendingAssignments` (queue), `TransferAssignmentDialog` (transfer)
- **Key hooks:** `useModuleSchedulingUrl` (3-tier Cal.com URL resolution, enrollment-aware)
- **Key edge functions:** `notify-assignment-submitted` (async, broadcasts), `notify-assignment-graded` (async, notifies client)
- **Note:** `client_instructors`/`client_coaches` are separate from `enrollment_module_staff` — used for general coaching relationships (decisions, tasks), not synced by design

## Known Issues
- (none currently — all critical/high items documented in roadmap above)

## Resolved Issues
- **C1 — Credits FeatureGate (2026-02-15):** Removed FeatureGate wrapper from Credits.tsx — credits is universal across all plans.
- **C2 — AuthContext role fallback (2026-02-15):** Removed silent `roles = ["client"]` fallback from 4 locations. Added `authError` state + error/no-roles UI in ProtectedRoute. Unblocks safe Google OAuth re-enable.
- **C3 — Credit loss on failed enrollment (2026-02-15):** Created `enroll_with_credits` atomic RPC. Credits + enrollment in single transaction with auto-rollback. Also fixed M6 (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` on `consume_credits_fifo`).
- **H1 — Empty client dashboard (2026-02-16):** Added OnboardingWelcomeCard with 4-step getting-started checklist. Auto-hides on completion or dismiss (localStorage).
- **C4 — Cal.com orphaned bookings (2026-02-16):** Auto-cancel Cal.com booking on DB failure in both calcom-create-booking and calcom-webhook. Added BOOKING_CANCELLED handler for two-way sync. Created `_shared/calcom-utils.ts` helper.
- **H2 — File upload validation (2026-02-16):** Created `src/lib/fileValidation.ts` with bucket-specific MIME/size presets. Applied to all 13 upload interfaces across admin, client, coach, instructor areas.
- **H3 — AI input limits (2026-02-16):** Created `_shared/ai-input-limits.ts` with truncation helpers. Applied to 3 AI edge functions (generate-reflection-prompt, course-recommendations, decision-insights).
- **H5 — Express interest status (2026-02-16):** Added "My Interest Registrations" section to ClientDashboard with color-coded status badges (pending/contacted/enrolled/declined).
- **H4 — Welcome email (2026-02-15):** verify-signup now triggers send-welcome-email after successful verification (non-blocking, service role auth).
- **H7 — N+1 query (2026-02-15):** Replaced per-module progress queries with single batched `.in()` query in ClientDetail.
- **H8 — Assignment grading guard (2026-02-15):** Added status check — grading only allowed when assignment is "submitted".
- **Preprod Auth Email Hook (2026-02-14):** Incorrect Authorization header. Fixed with correct service role key.
- **Profiles RLS recursion (2026-02-14):** Circular RLS on profiles. Fixed via `client_can_view_staff_profile()` SECURITY DEFINER function.

- **Next steps:** P0 cohort scheduling gaps (G1-G6) → Development Profile (DP1-DP4) → Phase 5 → DP5-DP7 → Content Tier 2 xAPI → Phase 3 AI

## npm Scripts
```
npm run verify              # lint + typecheck + tests + build
npm run deploy:all          # develop → preprod → main (with confirmation)
npm run deploy:functions    # edge functions to prod (--only fn1, -- preprod)
npm run push:migrations     # DB migrations (-- preprod, -- all)
npm run sync:data           # config tables (--from prod --to preprod)

```

## Env Vars (41 total)
Full reference: `docs/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIGURATION.md`
- NEVER share: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `OAUTH_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, Cal.com/TalentLMS/Circle keys
- Safe to share: `RESEND_API_KEY` (with staging override), `GCP_*` (stateless)
- MUST set on all envs: `SITE_URL` (falls back to prod URL if unset)

## Notes
- `npm install` needs `--legacy-peer-deps` (react-day-picker conflict)
- Edge functions all have `verify_jwt = false` — custom auth checks inside
- `send-auth-email` uses Standard Webhooks HMAC (not Bearer token)
- Supabase RPC params must use `null` not `undefined` (undefined stripped from JSON)
- Demo credentials: all use `DemoPass123!` — see `supabase/seed.sql`
