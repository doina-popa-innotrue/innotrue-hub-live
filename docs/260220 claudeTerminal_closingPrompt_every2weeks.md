Review MEMORY.md and prune it:

1. Move fully resolved items older than 2 phases into completed-work.md
2. Remove any ✅ items that are no longer relevant as context
3. Keep only: current state, active roadmap, known issues, key architectural 
   decisions that still affect ongoing work
4. The file should reflect what's true now, not what's done

Show me a summary of what was moved or removed before saving.
Wait for my confirmation before writing the changes.
