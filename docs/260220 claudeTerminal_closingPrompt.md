Before we finish:

1. Run `npm run verify` — fix anything that fails before proceeding
2. Update MEMORY.md — current state, resolved items, any new roadmap items
3. Update completed-work.md with everything we did today
4. Update your memory with exactly where we stopped — phase, step, 
   file, and what's next
5. Prune MEMORY.md if needed — move resolved items older than 2 phases 
   to completed-work.md, keep the file focused on current state only
6. Tell me the next immediate step so I can pick up cleanly next session

Wait for my confirmation before I exit.
