Pause before continuing.

1. Update MEMORY.md — mark completed items ✅, add any new decisions or gotchas
2. Update completed-work.md with a summary of what was just implemented
3. Update your memory with our exact position — phase, step, file, what's next
4. Note any architectural decisions or edge cases in the relevant docs file
5. Run `npm run verify` — if it fails, fix and re-run before reporting
6. Tell me current state in one sentence and what the next step is

Wait for my confirmation before continuing.
